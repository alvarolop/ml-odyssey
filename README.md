# ML Odyssey

A personal exploration of machine learning concepts, inspired by the structure and clarity of Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow.


## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to learn and explore machine learning and deep learning step by step.

In addition, I aim to provide clear, easy-to-follow examples that anyone can deploy and test on their own infrastructure.

By sharing practical, reproducible code and workflows, I hope to make advanced machine learning concepts accessible to a wider audience and encourage hands-on experimentation.



## What You’ll Find Here

* **Jupyter Notebooks**:
Interactive notebooks for each major topic, featuring code, visualizations, and explanations. Notebooks are organized for clarity, reproducibility, and collaboration, leveraging the latest JupyterLab features, interactive widgets, and AI-powered code assistance.

* **Kubeflow Pipelines**:
For selected topics, Kubeflow pipeline implementations demonstrate scalable, production-oriented machine learning workflows. These pipelines are built using the latest Kubeflow Pipelines v2 SDK, supporting modularity, versioning, and enhanced visualization.

* **Modern ML Tools**:
Integration of tools such as AutoML, Hugging Face models, Dask for parallel computing, and GPU acceleration for deep learning tasks.







## Credits

This repository draws inspiration from the book `Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition by Aurélien Géron (O’Reilly, 2019)`. While the code and examples here are original and make use of different datasets, I would like to acknowledge the book for its accessible approach to complex machine learning topics.

This project also reflects the knowledge and skills developed during my studies in the `Máster in Business Analytics & Big Data` at IMF Smart Education, in collaboration with Indra.

Let me know if you’d like further refinements or additions!
